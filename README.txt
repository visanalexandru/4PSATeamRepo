		README

	This is just an exercise to understand a little better
the Github commands. The index.html and style.css files I found
on the internet so I don't know much about them.

	Now I modified the README to have a commit on a local
branch, it's not that important.
	Ok, I'm just going to cause a merge conflict here, don't
mind me.
